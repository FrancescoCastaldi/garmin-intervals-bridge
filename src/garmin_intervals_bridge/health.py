"""Daily health run: probe both services and look for errors that would otherwise stay silent.

Most failures are handled on purpose and do not end a run: an activity that
fails gets a backoff, a Garmin endpoint that errors is noted in the raw
archive, a field Garmin stops delivering simply stops appearing. This run
turns those into one daily finding list. Exit 2 (alert mail) only for
findings that need a human; everything else is reported with exit 0.

Findings that alert
  - a service failing longer than BRIDGE_STALE_HOURS (probe)
  - no scheduled run recorded for 3 hours (timers dead, unit broken)
  - a Garmin wellness endpoint erroring on each of the last 3 archived days
  - a wellness field Garmin delivered on most of the previous week but on none
    of the last 2 finished days (a changed response shape, a stopped sensor);
    what the athlete logs or starts (weight, food, drink, Health Snapshots)
    is left out, a day without it is a day without logging
  - activities failed twice or more, or uploads pending reconciliation

Informational: what the last day did, a day boundary in UTC, a newer release (notices.py).
Findings that alert also go out by e-mail / push message when set up, at most once a day
(alerts.py).
