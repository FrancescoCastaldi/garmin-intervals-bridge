"""What a bridge running unseen in the background has to tell its owner.

  - A newer release on PyPI: one log line and a health finding a day, with the update
    command (BRIDGE_UPDATE_CHECK=false turns the check off; it asks pypi.org, nothing else
    is sent).
  - Garmin's login expired: everything stops until someone signs in again, and nobody
    reads a log file. One NOTE in the Intervals calendar on that day, once per episode,
    only by a bridge that may write (--apply); never deleted by the bridge.
    BRIDGE_INTERVALS_NOTES=false turns it off. And an e-mail or push message, when
    set up (alerts.py).
